# Nessus Vulnerability Report â€“ Localhost

## Target: 127.0.0.1
- Scanner Used: Nessus Essentials
- Total Vulnerabilities Found: 41

## Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

### 1. SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted
- **Plugin ID**: 51192
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: The scanned host is using an SSL certificate that cannot be verified against trusted Certificate Authorities. This could allow attackers to intercept encrypted traffic via man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Fix**: Replace the certificate with one from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

### 2. SMB Signing Not Required
- **Plugin ID**: 57608
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: The host does not require SMB signing, leaving SMB traffic open to tampering or interception.
- **Fix**: Enforce SMB signing through system policy or group policy.

## Informational Findings

39 findings were informational. These include:
- Protocol support (TLS 1.2/1.3, SMB, HTTP, etc.)
- OS fingerprinting
- Netstat port scanner results
- Certificate mismatch alerts
- MySQL, UPnP, and service banner detections

These results do not pose immediate risk but help profile the system and should be reviewed for unnecessary services.

## Recommendations

- **Fix SSL Certificate Issues**: Use only certificates issued by well-known trusted CAs.
- **Enable SMB Signing**: Harden file-sharing protocols to prevent MITM attacks.
- **Limit Exposed Services**: Disable unused protocols or ports.
- **Regular Scanning**: Perform monthly scans and address new findings promptly.
- **Keep Software Updated**: Apply OS and application patches regularly.
